### **Work Division Strategy**  

**Naomiâ€™s Responsibilities â€“ Question Management & Scoring**
âœ… Categorize question (Easy, Medium, Hard), their correct answers and options
âœ… found meme


**Aishwaryaâ€™s Responsibilities â€“ Game Logic & User Interaction**
âœ… used file handling to and optimised the quiz questions
âœ… Handle UI components (difficulty selection screen, meme display, scoreboard, score history, login credential or guest profile).
âœ… immediate feedback 

**Why This is Truly Balanced Now:**
Naomi handles the backend logic (questions, validation, scoring).
Aishwarya handles the frontend experience (difficulty selection, question display, meme integration). 
Both roles contribute equally to making the game function AND engaging.
No one is stuck doing the harder or more tedious parts alone.


----------------------------------
No worries! Since you didnâ€™t work on **difficulty selection and randomization** on Feb 26, Iâ€™ll shift those tasks into later stages while keeping the balance intact. Hereâ€™s the **revised timeline**:

### **Why This is Now Balanced:**  
- Your **difficulty selection & randomization work** is now scheduled **for March 31**, so youâ€™re not behind.
