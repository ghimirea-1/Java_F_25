### **Work Division Strategy**  

**Naomi’s Responsibilities – Question Management & Scoring**
✅ Expand and categorize question sets (Easy, Medium, Hard).
✅ Implement answer validation to check if a response is correct.
✅ Provide immediate feedback based on user responses.
✅ Develop and manage point distribution logic for different difficulties.

**Aishwarya’s Responsibilities – Game Logic & User Interaction**
✅ Implement difficulty selection at the start of the game.
✅ Develop the random question generator to pull from Naomi’s categorized questions.
✅ Ensure the points system is correctly integrated with gameplay.
✅ Handle UI components (difficulty selection screen, meme display, scoreboard).
✅ Integrate memes and fun elements for engagement.

**Why This is Truly Balanced Now:**
Naomi handles the backend logic (questions, validation, scoring).
Aishwarya handles the frontend experience (difficulty selection, question display, meme integration). 
Both roles contribute equally to making the game function AND engaging.
No one is stuck doing the harder or more tedious parts alone.


----------------------------------
No worries! Since you didn’t work on **difficulty selection and randomization** on Feb 26, I’ll shift those tasks into later stages while keeping the balance intact. Here’s the **revised timeline**:
